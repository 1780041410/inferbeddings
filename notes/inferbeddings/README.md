Rules - options:
	1) MLN datasets already w. rules
	2) Manually craft the rules starting from error analysis on dev set
	3) Second dataset for mining rules, connect to first dataset and inject the rules (w. manual filtering for alignment mismatches (EMNLP, NYT data))
	4) Take full training set, rule mining, remove 50-90% of facts so rules do not have high coverage - cold start problem (NACL)
